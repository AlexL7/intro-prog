            <p>The majority of the web is made up of <b>HTML</b> connected
            together via hyperlinks</p>
            <p>The main components of the Web consist of :<br>
            - Me<br>
            - Internet<br>
            - Computers<br>
            - Servers<br></p>
            <p>Servers are computers that host files and uses HTTP for

        <h2>HTML Overview</h2>
        <div class="notes">
            <p>HTML files contain <em>elements</em> which make up the content
            of the document and they are surround by <b>tags</b>. Tags can be
            used to modify the formatting of the element for example using
            <b>bold</b> or <em>italic</em> text.</p>
            <p>HTML attributes are tools to add links and images into the
            document. href are used to add a URL and src are used for images.

            <p>HTML always follow a basic structure, starting with !DOCTYPE
            indicating it is an HTML file, followed by a head usually
            containing a title and then followed by a body with the bulk of the
            content.</p>

            you we can see changes made in the code directly effect the webpage
            youâ€™re making.<br>
            -The 3 primary languages front-end developers use are <b>HTML</b>,

            <p><b>Exploring the Web</b></p>
            <p>HTML files are the main structure of websites, and <em>CSS</em>
            is used in style. Javascript is responsible for the interactive
            components that change the elements of the site.<br>
            Website browser such as <a href=
            "https://www.google.com/chrome/">Google chrome</a> have
            <b>development tools</b> to help see the structure of the website.
            Through exploring the tools we can see that all the elements are
            rectangular and all the text in the file is shown on the
            webpage.</p>

        <h2>CSS & Style</h2>
        <div class="notes">
            <p><b>Style and Boxes</b></p>
            <p>HTML is used for structure the same way <b>CSS</b> is used for
            styling and formatting a webpage. Specifically CSS changes how an
            element looks through the either the <span style=
            "color:red">colour</span>, background,font size, border, margin
            etc...<br>
            Tags surround elements and have different functions and an
            important one for formatting is <b>div</b>. Div creates an
            imaginary box around an element and can give a class attribute
            which works as a label.</p>

        <div class="notes">
            <p><b>CSS - Breakdown</b></p>
            <p>When writing CSS it is broken down into 4 main components.
            Starts with the <b>selector</b> which is used to target the
            elements that are assigned to a class or attribute. Within the
            selector there is a <b>declaration</b> which is divided into the
            <b>property</b> and <b>value</b> of that property.<br>
            When applying a selector it will apply the same declarations to all
            the similar tags within the HTML document. Another important part
            is to apply prefixes such as <b>webkit,moz,ms</b> so that the CSS
            style will work across different browsers.</p>

        <div class="notes">
            <p><b>The Box Model</b></p>
            <p>HTML documents are always organised into boxes and using CSS we
            can manipulate to obtain our desired outcome. Boxes have many
            properties such as the margin, border padding and content. Using a
            box-sizing declaration can help keep the box the same size even if
            the page changes.<br>
            Boxes can be changed depending to pixi number or as a percentage to
            the page, it is important to set the appropriate parameters
            depending on the wanted outcome of the box.</p>
